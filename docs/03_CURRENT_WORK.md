# Restaurant App — Current Work

## Purpose

## Repository / Branch Reality

Current line for this release:

```text
release/kitchen-sync   (base: 045dfd5 = origin/main)
```

`feat/floor-map` remains the historical Floor/Kitchen development line. It is NOT
merged and NOT approved as a whole: only its Kitchen slice is, and this release
carries that slice alone.

Kitchen source checkpoint on `feat/floor-map`:

```text
13c0fa2  feat(kitchen): close stations B1 B2 and add audit handoff
9bd5b73  fix(kitchen): complete Stage A/B2 hunks left in shared files + docs
fd11ecd  fix(kitchen): include Stage A floor per-station readiness strip
f4dd079  fix(docs): B2.2 status consistency  ← independently re-audited: APPROVED WITH NON-BLOCKING NOTES
```

`a79dd95` ("commit required app/services/reservations dependency") is **excluded**:
its subject is mislabelled — `active_holds()` is called only from `floor_plan()`,
never from Kitchen code, so it is Reservations work, not a Kitchen dependency.

On `release/kitchen-sync` the Kitchen slice is **reconstructed onto `045dfd5`**, not
cherry-picked, because those commits sit on top of ~40 unapproved Floor UI commits.
Seven enumerated cut points separate them. `8a0e349` is a superseded historical HEAD
on the old line, not the current tip of anything.

This branch is **not merged, not pushed, and not deployed**. Nothing here describes
production runtime.

Floor and Reservations work is **entirely absent from this branch**. It remains on
`feat/floor-map` (committed there, plus uncommitted work in that worktree), unapproved
and unmerged. `app/services/reservations.py` does not exist here at all; the Kitchen
router's import of it was removed as part of the reconstruction.

Important:

- payment/security remediation is on a separate divergent branch;
- inspect current `git status`, current branch, and relevant files before any new implementation or integration work.

## Kitchen Status

### Stage A — APPROVED / CLOSED

Includes Station, explicit routing, `OrderItem.station_id` snapshot-at-fire, Unassigned, KDS filtering, inactive-station live-work reachability, Expo/Floor station presentation, importer protections, and filter-before-limit.

Locked invariants include `READY != SERVED`, explicit routing, coursing preservation, unchanged payment gate, and historical routing immutability.

### Stage B1 — APPROVED / CLOSED

Includes PreparationTask foundation, modifier routing fields, multi-station task creation at fire, snapshots, Unassigned, rollup, `fire_seq`, fire-batch uniqueness, conflict-safe/idempotent creation, backfill/readiness, and `fired_items_without_tasks(db)`.

Compatibility remains:

- `OrderItem.station_id`;
- `OrderItem.kitchen_status`;
- tasks do not own SERVED.

### Stage B2 — APPROVED / CLOSED

Design artifact:

```text
KITCHEN_STATIONS_STAGE_B2_v3_DESIGN.md — APPROVED WITH NON-BLOCKING NOTES
```

Implementation status:

```text
B2.1 (task-based KDS reads)     — APPROVED
B2.2 (per-task READY + bridge)  — APPROVED / CLOSED
```

B2.1 and B2.2 were implemented, independently audited, and fixed per findings. The
committed Kitchen checkpoint (`f4dd079`) was then **independently re-audited: APPROVED
WITH NON-BLOCKING NOTES**, so Kitchen Stage B2 / B2.2 are APPROVED / CLOSED.

Non-blocking note: the re-audit reused the four previously-executed Kitchen tests
(`test_stations`, `test_prep_tasks`, `test_kds_task_reads`, `test_kds_task_ready`,
re-run green from a clean tree) and the existing PostgreSQL concurrency evidence — no
new test execution was required.

Current B2 implementation includes:

- task-based KDS station reads from snapshotted `PreparationTask.station_id`;
- one `OrderItem` sale line with task/station subrows;
- task-based station-work badge counts;
- hard no-hybrid activation gate;
- per-task READY;
- parent Order lock + post-lock task/sibling refresh;
- `OrderItem.kitchen_status` rollup;
- legacy kitchen-status compatibility bridge;
- all-or-nothing validation for task-backed legacy writes;
- explicit destructive `Un-ready (all stations)` behavior;
- `READY != SERVED`;
- payment-gate semantics unchanged.

Activation gate:

```text
B2_2_ACTIVE
AND kitchen_b2_active
AND fired_items_without_tasks(db) == 0
```

B2.2 PostgreSQL concurrency evidence:

```text
KITCHEN_STATIONS_STAGE_B2_2_POSTGRES_CONCURRENCY_EVIDENCE.md
PASS
```

The proof used real PostgreSQL 16 with two independent sessions. Session B blocked on the parent Order `FOR UPDATE`, then observed Session A's committed READY state after the lock and completed the correct final rollup.

### Kitchen work NOT authorized now

- B3/B4;
- Expo/Floor task-read migration beyond the approved compatibility behavior;
- task-owned SERVED/reporting;
- remake/re-fire model;
- `OrderItem.station_id` cleanup/removal;
- richer task states;
- WebSocket/SSE.

## Payment / Security — Approved but Unmerged

Separate branch:

```text
fix/p0-security-and-payments
```

Status:

```text
Stage 1  — APPROVED BUT UNMERGED
Stage 2a — APPROVED BUT UNMERGED
Stage 2b — APPROVED BUT UNMERGED
Stage 2c — WIP / AUTHORIZED-NOT-CLOSED
```

Stage 1/2a/2b remain approved target architecture. Their absence from the current branch is divergence, not rejection.

Stage 2c is not part of the approved baseline.

## Current Payment Reality on Floor/Kitchen Line

Current line uses Payment + PaymentAllocation seat ledger, direct Square Terminal flow, and local Refund rows.

Current risks include:

- processor success can precede durable local Payment persistence;
- local card Refund does not execute Square refund;
- full processor reconciliation is absent;
- production critical config can fail open.

Do not fix these incidentally during unrelated work.

## Future Payment/Security Integration — NOT AUTHORIZED

A controlled integration slice is required to reconcile approved Payment/Security Stage 1/2a/2b with the current Floor/Kitchen line.

Do not:

- merge `fix/p0-security-and-payments` wholesale;
- integrate Stage 2c;
- integrate while working-tree state is unresolved;
- combine payment integration with unrelated feature work.

## Current Risk / Evidence Backlog

### High
- current `SECRET_KEY` production fallback risk;
- Square charge durability window;
- card refunds are local-only.

### Medium / unresolved
- incomplete processor identity/reconciliation on current line;
- table-open concurrency;
- reservation overlap control not confirmed;
- narrow financial/config audit trail;
- `test_admin.py` failing in the inspected working tree while backend authz cases passed;
- production `DATABASE_URL`/cookie-security defaults.

### Kitchen evidence notes
- SQLite functional/regression tests passed for B2 implementation packages;
- real PostgreSQL B2.2 concurrency proof passed;
- the B2.2 proof was a focused contract proof, not a production-system certification;
- startup warning literal remained inspection-based rather than a dedicated runtime test;
- no production execution was performed.

### Deferred Kitchen backlog
- normalized Station-name DB uniqueness;
- duplicate routing-import IDs;
- CSV formula-injection hardening;
- Expo/Floor task migration;
- modifier-routing UI;
- `OrderItem.station_id` removal;
- task SERVED/reporting;
- remake/re-fire;
- richer task states;
- WebSocket/SSE.

### Other evidence gaps
- no production execution/data mutation;
- no live provider execution in fact audit;
- no load benchmark;
- no real-device/browser validation;
- no restore-drill evidence.

## Multi-Agent Development Model

Claude and Codex are both eligible developers. Every active implementation slice must
identify exactly one implementer and an independent reviewer. Default cross-review:
Claude implements → Codex reviews; Codex implements → Claude reviews. The implementer
may not independently approve the same slice. (Full rules: `docs/05_AI_HANDOFF.md`;
policy: ADR-028.)

### Domain preference (not feature authorization)

```text
Claude — Kitchen / KDS / Expo; core Order lifecycle; Payment/Security when separately authorized
Codex  — Schedule / Reservations; other self-contained modules when explicitly authorized
```

### Governance state

```text
Governance agent: NOT YET ASSIGNED
Human authority: repository owner
Technical enforcement: GitHub/CI governance gates NOT YET CONFIGURED
```

Do not claim autonomous governance enforcement is active until those mechanisms are
actually configured.

### Parallel-work rule

Before parallel implementation begins, each slice must record: module/slice,
implementer, reviewer, branch/worktree, authorized scope, out-of-scope boundaries,
evidence requirements. Use separate branches/worktrees whenever practical.

### Shared core

No implicit implementation authorization exists for shared-core / cross-domain changes
(Order/OrderItem lifecycle, Payments/Refunds, auth/permissions, shared migration
architecture, DayClose/timezone, reporting contracts, Kitchen cross-domain behavior,
provider integrations). These require explicit design or scope expansion first.

### Schedule / Reservations

Codex is the preferred implementer for a future Schedule / Reservations slice. This
preference does **not** authorize implementation yet. Before implementation, the
authorized slice must define its branch/worktree and confirm whether the work touches
shared table, Order, BusinessDay, permissions, migration, payment, or timezone behavior.

### Current checkpoint (unchanged)

The Kitchen closure recorded above (Stage A / B1 / B2 and B2.2 = APPROVED / CLOSED;
B3/B4 = DEFERRED / NOT AUTHORIZED) and the Payment/Security statuses remain unchanged.

## Release A — integration state

Kitchen Stage A / B1 / B2 / B2.2 has been reconstructed onto `045dfd5` on
`release/kitchen-sync`, per the owner-authorized Rev 3 integration design (Codex:
`APPROVED WITH NON-BLOCKING NOTES`).

Schema delta introduced by this branch, and nothing else:

```text
4 columns   station_id on menu_item, order_item, modifier, modifier_option
            (INTEGER REFERENCES station(id), nullable)
3 tables    station, preparation_task, preparation_task_modifier
1 index     uq_prep_task_batch (order_item_id, fire_seq, COALESCE(station_id,-1))
0           Floor or Reservations tables/columns
```

`_pg_boolean_ddl` from the `045dfd5` base is preserved unchanged.

## Next Authorized Action

```text
NONE — awaiting independent Codex review of the integrated branch
```

Not authorized: push, merge into `main`, deployment, or any production mutation.
PostgreSQL verification (fresh bootstrap, pre-release upgrade, concurrency proof)
has NOT been executed and is a precondition for release approval.

Do not start B3/B4, reopen B2, begin Payment/Security integration (Release B), or
integrate Floor/Reservations without a new authorized slice.
